Using the [Scriptable app](https://scriptable.app), we can create the Scriptures Daily widget for Apple devices[^1] only.

If the JW Library® app is installed, tapping on the widget will open the app to read the Scriptures Daily. If the app is not installed, tapping on the widget will open the [Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY™](https://wol.jw.org) to read the Daily Text.
